description: This tool is a rule editor for procedural level generation, it has been developed using ImGui and Qt.

---
This tool has been developed for editing rules for a grammar graph based level generation system. 

<h3>ImGui Version</h3>
First, the tool was developed in ImGui in 8 weeks during my second year. The tool was part of a UWP(Universal Windows Platform) custom-engine for rogue-like games.
Unfortunately this project never had the chance of having a game developed with, the following footage is from the tech demo for the end of the project.

<h4>Features:</h4>

+ Rules import/export.
+ Rules Editor.
+ Generation simulation (Preview).

<h3>Qt Version</h3>

During my third year i had the chance of using this system and tool to develop an year long game project (<a href="/projects/school/CaptainStarshot">Captain Stashot</a>).
The tool was reimplemented in Qt, which was a great learning experiences as tool programmer. Having team members using the tool greatly helped improving on ui/ux, editor and add quality of life features.
