I worked on this project for the entirety of my third year at BUAS(Breda University of Applied Sciences, formerly NHTV).
During this period I mostly worked on the PCG system, the Tool used for the design of its rules and on Graphics.
Finally, the last part of the project, I worked as tech Lead and learned about project management using Kanban.

<h3>Procedural Generation</h3>

One of my main responsibility during this project was Procedural generation.
The system used to procedurally generate our levels is based on Graph Grammars.
During this project, I had the opportunity to port to Qt and further develop a tool I previously created to create and edit rules for this system (<a href="/projects/school/GrammarsTool">More information regarding Graph Grammars tool</a>). 
Additionally, for the first time a tool I created was used by other developers, which allowed me to improve the tool.
Finally, I also implemented a tailored system in unreal to convert grammars into levels.

<h3>Graphics</h3>

During this project i had the chance to explore and learn more about UE4 shading pipeline. 
One of the main tasks was optimization and by working on this I had the chance to use most of the tools provided by unreal to profile and optimize GPU performance.
Furthermore, I've worked on the shading. It consist in a flat looking toon shader, with procedural brush strokes and outlines.
