This project was developed during my second year at BUAS(Breda University of Applied Sciences ex NHTV).

The project started as a custom cross-platform engine for PS4 and Windows, developed by a team of only programmers. After the first eight weeks of development, I and other students, mostly artists and designers, joined the team to develop a game using this engine in 8 weeks.

<h2 class="section-heading" id="My Contribution">My Contribution</h2>
 <hr class="primary">
During this period, my primary role was being Team Lead, which was a good experience with many learning opportunities, especially considering the size of the team. We used Scrum methodologies for team management, I had the chance to use Jira as planning and team management application.

My other role was gameplay, with a particular focus on vehicle movement. Joining the team during engine development and working in a completely unknown codebase was quite the challenge. The vehicle movement system is entirely physics based. I learned how to use NVIDIAâ€™s physics API PhysX, which is also used by many commercial engines; this allowed me to have a lower level control over the physics and polish the movement to a great extent.

We delivered a working game with two tracks, two vehicles and three skins for each vehicle; the game also runs exceptionally smoothly on PC and between 50 to 60 fps on PS4.
